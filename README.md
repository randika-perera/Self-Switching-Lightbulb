# Self-Switching-Lightbulb
We designed a light bulb that turns on and off automatically according to external environmental conditions to increase user convenience as well as to reduce unnecessary power consumption. The device used light sensors and motion sensors to achieve its requirements. This project required designing a printed circuit board for the final circuit and designing a 3D printed enclosure to encase everything. 

The logic utilized in the device is given below,
| **Natural Light Condition** | **Human Presence** | **Switching State of Bulb (Output)** |
|:---------------------------:|:------------------:|:------------------------------------:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|
| In Dark                     | Yes                | ON                                   |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |
| In Dark                     | No                 | OFF                                  |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |
| In Light                    | Yes                | OFF                                  |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |
| In light                    | No                 | OFF                                  |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |
